## Description
This project is a Kanban board application that integrates JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for user login and session management. The board allows users to create, update, and manage tasks across different columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). JWTs are used to authenticate users, ensuring that only authorized individuals can interact with the board. The authentication system helps protect sensitive routes and data, providing a secure environment for task management. This project demonstrates a combination of front-end task organization and secure back-end authentication using JWTs.
